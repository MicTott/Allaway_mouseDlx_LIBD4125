# Allaway_mouseDlx_LIBD4125

Repo for downloading and working with the mouse cortex scRNA-seq dateset from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03933-1. 

Specifically, I am interested in downloading the V1 P28 datasets which were used to characterize subclasses of SST neurons here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.510081v1.
